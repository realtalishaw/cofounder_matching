            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Your privacy is important to us. It is Find A Co-Founder's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a href="https://findacofounder.online">https://findacofounder.online</a>, and other sites we own and operate.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Information we collect</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so - for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let's go over the information that we collect.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Information you provide to us</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
              <li>Basic account information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Find A Co-Founder account to provide a username and email address.</li>
              <li>Transaction and billing information: If you buy something from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</li>
              <li>Communications with us: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Support Team about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Information we collect automatically</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We also collect some information automatically:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
              <li>Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
              <li>Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at our public forums, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).</li>
              <li>Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Information we collect from other sources</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your Find A Co-Founder account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">How we use information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We use the information we collect in various ways to provide and improve our Services, including to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Services</li>
            <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our Services</li>
            <li>Understand and analyze how you use our Services</li>
            <li>Develop new products, services, features, and functionality</li>
            <li>Communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Service, and for marketing and promotional purposes</li>
            <li>Send you emails</li>
            <li>Find and prevent fraud</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Sharing information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We do not sell our users' private personal information.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
            <li>Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration and other related services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by us), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites (such as the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
            <li>Legal Requests: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>

            <li>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Find A Co-Founder, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
            <li>Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Find A Co-Founder goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">How long we keep information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it and we're not legally required to keep it.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Security</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. Please note, though, that no website or internet transmission is completely secure, so while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are in the European Economic Area, please note that where necessary, your information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area to countries that may not have the same level of protection as is provided by the laws of your country. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Contact Us</h3>
